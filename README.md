# **Advanced Lane Finding Project**

[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)  ![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-Python-green.svg)

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

## Rubric Points
### Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/571/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Writeup / README

#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  [Here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/blob/master/writeup_template.md) is a template writeup for this project you can use as a guide and a starting point.

You're reading it!

### Camera Calibration

#### 1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.
I started by creating the object points in the chessboard `objp`.
Then the chessboard corners are found from all but the first image
in the `camera_cal` folder.  Each images is first converted from RGB to Gray scale, then the chessboard corner image points are found using `cv2.findChessboardCorners`. The object points and image points of each images are collected in two python lists and fed into the function `calibrate`, defined in `ImageProcessing/process.py`.  This function returns the camera matrix and distortion coefficients.  The camera matrix and the distortion coefficients are then passed to the function `undist` to undistort the image.
Below is an example of undistorted image, in which the origin image was not used in calibration process.
